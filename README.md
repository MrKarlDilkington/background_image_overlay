**Tips For Best Results:**
- to improve performance, avoid using overly large or poorly optimized images
- for targeting desktop and tablet displays, an image aspect ratio between 4:3 and 16:10 often works well
- a happy medium for quality and size is between 1200 x 900 pixels and 1600 x 1200 pixels (ranging between 100KB and 250KB in size)
- remember to keep your site performance budget in mind
